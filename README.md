# Quantitative-Trading
A repository for resource material, trial code and blogs about quantitative trading

Note: I do not own these resources, however all of them are allowed to be freely distributed.

This repository is for anyone who might need some beginner level resources to get started into quantitative trading.

I keep adding things to it as I learn more about this field!
